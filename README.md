The Theme Development branch is for creating the final WP theme and *should not be merged* with any other branch.

Setup with `npm install`

If you want to use different config credentials than those in the gulpfile, create a config.json file with your settings

Run with `npm run serve`

It should be used with the same dataset as the demo theme.
